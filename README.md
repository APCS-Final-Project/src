Source Code for <Insert Name> Project

# Introduction
In this project, we create a QR code generator and scanner with the help of
[zebra crossing] (https://github.com/zxing/zxing) and [NyARToolkit]
(http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wp/). We use NyARToolkit's marker recognition
system to identify certain QR codes and decrypt them using zebra crossing. Of
course, NyARToolkit is capable of much more than simply recognizing markers. We
wish to further develop this project by creating a system of augmented reality
using QR codes as markers themselves.
